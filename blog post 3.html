            <h2>Embarking on the Journey</h2>
            <p>
                Balancing a full-time internship while pursuing the final year of my computer engineering degree has been one of the most challenging yet rewarding experiences of my life. As a student at K J Somaiya College of Engineering, which comes under Somaiya Vidyavihar University, I embarked on this journey in December 2024. With graduation on the horizon in June 2025, I wanted to share my story, my struggles, and the invaluable lessons I've learned along the way.
            </p>

            <h3>Securing the Internship</h3>
            <p>
                The opportunity to work as a Business Analyst intern at Purplle, India's second-largest online beauty retailer, has been a dream come true. The process of securing this internship was both rigorous and exhilarating. It began with a campus hiring drive organized by Purplle, where I was fortunate to be one of the few selected candidates. The selection process involved multiple stages:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Resume-based Shortlisting:</strong> Highlighting my relevant skills and experiences in web development and business analysis.</li>
                    <li><strong>Aptitude Test:</strong> Testing my proficiency in English, mathematics, logical reasoning, and SQL.</li>
                    <li><strong>Interview:</strong> A grueling 90-minute interview with the hiring manager, where I showcased my knowledge and problem-solving abilities.</li>
                </ul>
                When I received the news of my selection, I was overjoyed. I joined Purplle in December 2024, ready to dive into the world of business analysis and e-commerce.
            </p>

            <h3>The Learning Experience</h3>

                Working at Purplle has been an eye-opening experience. It has allowed me to bridge the gap between classroom learning and real-world application. The practical knowledge I've gained has been invaluable:

                    <li><strong>Different from Academics:</strong> Instead of giving exams, I get to tackle exciting new problems every day, testing my abilities far greater than any exam ever could.

                    <li><strong>Resume Building:</strong> Adding valuable experiences to my resume, making me a stronger candidate for future opportunities. This internship is a testament to my hard work and dedication, enhancing my professional profile.</li>

                    <li><strong>Organization Evaluation:</strong> Assessing Purplle as a potential employer for future full-time roles. This internship provides me with the opportunity to evaluate the company and envision my future within it.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
