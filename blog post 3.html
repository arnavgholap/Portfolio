            <h2>Embarking on the Journey</h2>
            <p>
                Balancing a full-time internship while pursuing the final year of my computer engineering degree has been one of the most challenging yet rewarding experiences of my life. As a student at K J Somaiya College of Engineering, which comes under Somaiya Vidyavihar University, my University has a unique offering for students in their last semester. At the start of semester 8, students are given an option to either pursue academics or pursue a Semester Long Internship. I was intrigued with the prospect of getting real-world job experience even before graduation so I happily signed up for it.  With graduation on the horizon in June 2025, I wanted to share my story, my struggles, and the invaluable lessons I've learned along the way.

            <h2>More about Semester Long Internship program</h2>
<p>
    
The semester-long internship program is a key initiative aimed at providing undergraduate students with real-world, immersive learning experiences that bridge the gap between academic knowledge and industry practice. At K. J. Somaiya College of Engineering (KJSCE), the semester-long internship (SLI) is incorporated into the final year of the undergraduate curriculum, allowing students to gain hands-on exposure in a professional environment while continuing their academic progression. This program offers students the opportunity to work with industry partners, including major companies and startups, for a duration of approximately 14 weeks during their final semester.

The SLI serves as a significant experiential learning component, offering students the chance to apply classroom concepts to practical engineering problems, develop technical and soft skills, and enhance their career readiness. It helps students build professional networks, gain confidence, and explore potential career paths, all of which contribute to their personal and professional growth. Furthermore, the program benefits educational institutions by fostering industry collaborations, enhancing graduate employability, and providing feedback for refining curricula to better align with industry demands.

To ensure its success, the SLI program is carefully designed with clear learning objectives, structured mentorship, and rigorous assessment mechanisms. Students are required to complete coursework, including online NPTEL courses, and undergo interim evaluations and a final presentation. The program is structured to ensure both academic and practical rigor, ultimately preparing students for successful careers in the competitive job market.

            <h2>Securing the Internship</h2>
            <p>
                The opportunity to work as a Business Analyst intern at Purplle, India's second-largest online beauty retailer, has been a dream come true. The process of securing this internship was both rigorous and exhilarating. It began with a campus hiring drive organized by Purplle, where I was fortunate to be one of the few selected candidates. The selection process involved multiple stages:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Resume-based Shortlisting:</strong> Highlighting my relevant skills and experiences in web development and business analysis.</li>
                    <li><strong>Aptitude Test:</strong> Testing my proficiency in English, mathematics, logical reasoning, and SQL.</li>
                    <li><strong>Interview:</strong> A grueling 90-minute interview with the tech team, where I showcased my problem-solving abilities and demonstarted skills which I had learnt during my previous internship as a Business Analyst at Caarya. The learnings that this internship provided to me were crucial in cracking this interview, without which it would have been very difficult for me to gain this opportunity.</li>
                </ul>
                When I received the news of my selection, I was overjoyed. I joined Purplle in December 2024, ready to dive into the world of business analysis and e-commerce.
